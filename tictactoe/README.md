This is an implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses.

This is my initial attempt to implement a game AI, using the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning.

Given the small size of the game tree, it is trivial for the entire tree to be searched, making what few optimisations that have been implemented unnecessary, though educational.
